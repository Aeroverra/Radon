# Radon Java Obfuscator
Lightweight Java obfuscator by ItzSomebody. He tried to include as much attribution as possible, so if he missed you just open a pull-request and he will approve it because unlike some, he actually credits my sources (jk lol but I'll still credit sources).

Licenses get to go with the manifest in src/META-INF (yay!)

Usage: ```java -jar Radon.jar --config exampleconfig.yml```

Alternatively, you can also use ```java -jar Radon.jar --help``` for help.

```

Output: ClearChat-OBF.jar
StringEncryption: Light
InvokeDynamic: Normal
FlowObfuscation: Normal
LocalVariableObfuscation: Remove
LineNumberObfuscation: Remove
SourceNameObfuscation: Obfuscate
HideCode: True
Crasher: True
StringPool: True
NumberObfuscation: True
TrashClasses: 50
Renamer: True
WatermarkType: ConstantPool
WatermarkMessage: ItzSomebody
WatermarkKey: PASSWORD
ExpiryTime: 1/18/2018
ExpiryMessage: "YOUR SOFTWARE TRIAL HAS ENDED!!! YOU MUST NOW PAY $100000000 FOR THE FULL VERSION LULZ"
